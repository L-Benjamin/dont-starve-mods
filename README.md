## Mod List

Here is a list of my mods, along with the link to their steam page, if published:

### Aporkalypse Calendar Stop Button (`calendar-stop/`)

This mods, Calendar Stop for short, simply adds a third button to the aporkalypse calendar room, that stops/resumes the clock on press.

The aporkalypse will simply not happen while the clock is frozen.

### Wilba's Palace (`wilbas-palace/`)

This mods expands the palace with a few more rooms if you are playing as Wilba:
+ A courtyard.
+ A kitchen, regularly filled with food.
+ wilba's room, that acts as a normal buildable/expandable player house.
+ A hallway.

In addition, this mod fixes a bug where the pig queen would sometime follow Wilba forever. It also gives the pig queen some more lines with Wilba.
